# LGS_Solver-2x2_3x3 made for linear equations.
LGS Solver-2x2_3x3 is a program to solve linear 2x2 and 3x3 systems of equations.
It was written in Python and was originally intended to run on a TI Nspire CX II-T CAS calculator with Python.

# Usage: #
    Choose 1 for a 2x2 system. 
    Choose 2 for a 3x3 system.
    
    The variables (a1,b1,c1) and (a2,b2,c2) are the coefficients for the 2x2 system.
    The variables (a1,b1,c1,d1),(a2,b2,c2,d2) and (a3,b3,c3,d3) are for the 3x3 system.
